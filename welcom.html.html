        <center><h2>Elsa</h2></center>
        <h3>Elsa the Snow Queen is the deuteragonist of Disney's 2013 animated feature film Frozen, and the protagonist of its 2019 sequel. Born with the power of ice and snow, Elsa is the firstborn daughter of King Agnarr and Queen Iduna, the older sister of Queen Anna, and the former queen of Arendelle. Throughout most of her young life, Elsa feared that her powers were monstrous. Therefore, she isolated herself from the world as a means of protecting her family and kingdom. Elsa's anxieties would eventually trigger a curse that plunged Arendelle into an eternal winter. Through Anna's love, however, Elsa was able to control her powers and live peacefully amongst her people with a newfound self-confidence.</h3>

       <center><h2>Anna</h2></center>
       <h3>Queen Anna of Arendelle is the protagonist of Disney's 2013 animated feature film Frozen, and the deuteragonist of its 2019 sequel. She is the second-born daughter of King Agnarr and Queen Iduna, the younger sister of Elsa the Snow Queen, and the contemporary ruler of Arendelle. During their childhood, an accident involving Elsa's magic created a rift between the two sisters, leaving Anna devoid of love for many years. Despite this, Anna remained big-hearted and optimistic, albeit socially awkward. When their estrangement incidentally triggers an eternal winter, Anna embarks on a perilous journey to save her kingdom and mend the broken bond between herself and her sister.</h3>

        <center><h2>Kristoff</h2></center>
        <h3>Kristoff Bjorgman is the tritagonist of Disney's 2013 animated feature film Frozen, and a major character in its 2019 sequel. He is a Sami[2] outdoorsman that worked as an ice harvester with his reindeer Sven. Having been an orphan[3][4] who was raised by a colony of trolls in the mountains, Kristoff was initially wary of humans, believing them to be untrustworthy, cheating crooks. His outlook would slowly change upon meeting Princess Anna, whose warmheartedness would prove that people aren't as bad as Kristoff believed.</h3>

        <center><h2>Olaf</h2></center>
        <h3>Olaf is a major character in Disney's 2013 animated feature film Frozen and its 2019 sequel. He is a benevolent enchanted snowman created by Elsa. Along with the ability to reassemble his body, Olafâ€™s most prominent quirk is his love for summer and all things hot.He's Olaf and he likes warm hugs. Sprung from Elsa's magical powers, Olaf is by far the friendliest snowman to walk the mountains above Arendelle. His innocence, outgoing personality, and uncanny ability to disassemble himself at good and not-so-good times lead to some awkward, albeit laughable moments. He may also have the world's most impossible dream, but what he doesn't know won't melt him.</h3>

        <center><h2>Sven</h2></center>
        <h3>Sven is a major character in Disney's 2013 animated feature film, Frozen and its 2019 sequel. He is Kristoff's reindeer and best friend. Being a deer, Sven does not talk, and instead communicates through grunt-like vocals. However, Kristoff occasionally voices Sven's thoughts using a goofy "reindeer voice".A reindeer with the heart of a Labrador, Sven is Kristoff's loyal friend, sleigh-puller, and conscience. He makes sure his mountain-man companion is the stand-up guy Sven knows and loves, and does so without saying a word. A few emphatic snorts usually get his point across. Life would be perfect if only Kristoff would lose that ridiculous reindeer voice he likes to use when speaking for Sven (as if reindeer really talk that way).</h3>
